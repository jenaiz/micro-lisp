- [ ] extract a library from the big file ??
- [ ] prompt:
	- [X] exit command
	- [ ] help command
	- [ ] read more than one line for code

- [ ] investigate more about parsers
- [ ] improve how the enviroment works

- [ ] extend parsing and evaluation to support natives types: double... and operations for those types
 
- [ ] extend parsing and evaluation to support % operator: % -> sample % 10 6 is 4.
- [ ] add operator: ^ -> sample ^ 4 2 is 16
- [ ] add builtin function min 1 5 3 is 1
- [ ] add builtin function max 1 5 3 is 5
- [ ] add sample - 4 is -4 (negative number)
- [ ] add user defined types
- [ ] create list using square brackets: []
- [ ] Integration with system operative:
	- [ ] allow read & write from system
	- [ ] allow to use directories or see the content within a directory
- [ ] define macros
- [ ] include an implementation of hashtable
- [ ] pool allocation: allocate memory in the startup of the interpreter (avoid the uses of malloc in almost all the case)
- [ ] garbage collection: introduce a simple algorithm for garbage collection: Mark & Sweep (perhaps use this [idea](http://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2013/12/08/babys-first-garbage-collector/))
- [ ] tail call optimisation: ...
- [ ] lexical scoping: ...
- [ ] static typing: ...
- [ ] include packages to import libraries
- [ ] improve the library
