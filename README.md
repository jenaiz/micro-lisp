µLisp
=====

µLisp is Lisp interpreter using C. It is a personal implementation of list (look the *Story part*).

It is possible to compile all the stuff running:

```
make all
```
or build only the µlisp interpreter with:
```
make mlisp
```
Future
------
Now the challenge is to continue creating more features for µLisp, some of them come from the las two chapters where there some ideas to continue with the implementations

I have finished the book and have some ideas for the next steps. Stay tuned!

Story
-----
Behind of the µlisp's idea was the book: [Build your own Lisp](http://buildyourownlisp.com) from [Daniel Holden](https://github.com/orangeduck). The firsts release was following the tutorial. You can find a copy of the last version in [lispy.c](https://github.com/jenaiz/micro-lisp/blob/master/lispy.c) (I will be updating this file with the version from the book if there is an update).

Have fun!
