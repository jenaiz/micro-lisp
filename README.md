micro-lisp (µLisp)
==================

µLisp is Lisp interpreter using C. The idea started from the tutorial: [Build your own Lisp](http://buildyourownlisp.com).

For now, the implementation is more or less the same code as the tutorial. 

I would like to extend the code after finish the tutorial, for now I am enjoying hacking with C and Lisp.
